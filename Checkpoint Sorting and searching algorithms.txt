for i from 1 to n-1
    j = i
    while j > 0 and arr[j-1] > arr[j]

ex : For example, let's say we have an array arr = [5, 3, 1, 4, 2]. 
If we're trying to insert the element at index i = 3 (which has a value of 4), 
then we only need to consider the elements from index 0 to index i-1, which in this case are [5, 3, 1]. 
These elements are already sorted, so we just need to find the correct position to insert the element 4 within this sorted sequence.

step 1 :[5, 3, 1, 4, 2]. 
step 2 :[5, 3, 4, 1, 2].
step 3 :[5, 4, 3, 1, 2].

the element arr[3] is in the correct position.
